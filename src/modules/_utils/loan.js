* Fixed (French amortization method) – fixed installment amounts where the payment of overdue interest and capital share vary
* Fixed capital (Italian amortization method) – varying installment amounts where the payment of overdue interest share varies, while the capital share remains fixed
* Bullet amortization method – installments composed only of interest shares, while the final installment is equal to the initial capital amount plus the final interest share
* Balloon amortization method – only part of the capital amount is paid in installments until maturity and the rest in one final macro installment
* Custom amortization method – the installments are composed of capital share chosen one by one from the user
