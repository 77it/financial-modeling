 *
 * ## Examples
 *
 * What is the future value after 10 years of saving $100 now, with
 * an additional monthly savings of $100. Assume the interest rate is
 * 5% (annually) compounded monthly?
 *
 * ```javascript
 * import { fv } from 'financial'
 *
 * fv(0.05 / 12, 10 * 12, -100, -100) // 15692.928894335748
 * ```
 *
 * By convention, the negative sign represents cash flow out (i.e. money not
 * available today).  Thus, saving $100 a month at 5% annual interest leads
 * to $15,692.93 available to spend in 10 years.
 *
 * ## Notes
 *
 * The future value is computed by solving the equation:
 *
 * ```
 * fv + pv * (1+rate) ** nper + pmt * (1 + rate * when) / rate * ((1 + rate) ** nper - 1) == 0
 * ```
 *
 * or, when `rate == 0`:
 *
 * ```
 * fv + pv + pmt * nper == 0
 * ```

 *
 * ```javascript
 * import { pmt } from 'financial'
 *
 * pmt(0.075/12, 12*15, 200000) // -1854.0247200054619
 * ```
 *
 * In order to pay-off (i.e., have a future-value of 0) the $200,000 obtained
 * today, a monthly payment of $1,854.02 would be required.  Note that this
 * example illustrates usage of `fv` having a default value of 0.
 *
 * ## Notes
 *
 * The payment is computed by solving the equation:
 *
 * ```
 * fv + pv * (1 + rate) ** nper + pmt * (1 + rate*when) / rate * ((1 + rate) ** nper - 1) == 0

 * ```
 *
 * for `pmt`.
 *
 * Note that computing a monthly mortgage payment is only
 * one use for this function.  For example, `pmt` returns the
 * periodic deposit one must make to achieve a specified
 * future balance given an initial deposit, a fixed,
 * periodically compounded interest rate, and the total

 * @param values - Input cash flows per time period.
 *   By convention, net "deposits"

 * @returns Internal Rate of Return for periodic input values
 *
 * @since v0.0.17
 *
 * ## Notes
 *
 * The IRR is perhaps best understood through an example (illustrated
 * using `irr` in the Examples section below).
 *
 * Suppose one invests 100
 * units and then makes the following withdrawals at regular (fixed)
 * intervals: 39, 59, 55, 20.  Assuming the ending value is 0, one's 100
 * unit investment yields 173 units; however, due to the combination of
 * compounding and the periodic withdrawals, the "average" rate of return
 * is neither simply 0.73/4 nor (1.73)^0.25-1.
 * Rather, it is the solution (for `r`) of the equation:
 *
 * ```
 * -100 + 39/(1+r) + 59/((1+r)^2) + 55/((1+r)^3) + 20/((1+r)^4) = 0
 * ```
 *
 * In general, for `values` = `[0, 1, ... M]`,
 * `irr` is the solution of the equation:
 *
 * ```
 * \\sum_{t=0}^M{\\frac{v_t}{(1+irr)^{t}}} = 0
 * ```
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * ```javascript
 * import { irr } from 'financial'
 *
 * irr([-100, 39, 59, 55, 20]) // 0.28095
 * irr([-100, 0, 0, 74]) // -0.0955
 * irr([-100, 100, 0, -7]) // -0.0833
 * irr([-100, 100, 0, 7]) // 0.06206
 * irr([-5, 10.5, 1, -8, 1]) // 0.0886

 * const rate = 0.08
 * const cashflows = [-40_000, 5000, 8000, 12000, 30000]
 * npv(rate, cashflows) // 3065.2226681795255
 * ```
 *
 * It may be preferable to split the projected cashflow into an initial
 * investment and expected future cashflows. In this case, the value of
 * the initial cashflow is zero and the initial investment is later added
 * to the future cashflows net present value:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * const initialCashflow = cashflows[0]
 * cashflows[0] = 0
 *
 * npv(rate, cashflows) + initialCashflow // 3065.2226681795255
