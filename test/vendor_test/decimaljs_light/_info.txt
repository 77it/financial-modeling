edits to run the tests in my setup:
* created file `decimal.js`
* created file `helpers.js`
* renamed all files in `modules` replacing `.js` with `.test.js`
* in every files in `modules`:
  replaced `if (typeof T === 'undefined') require('../setup');`
  with `import { T } from '../helpers.js'; import { Decimal } from '../decimal.js';`
* corrected some little bugs in `modules` here and there
* reduced loops of test `powsqrt.test.js` from 1_000_000 to 5_000
